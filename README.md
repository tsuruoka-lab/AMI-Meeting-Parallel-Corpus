# Corpus Description

The [original AMI Meeting Corpus](http://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/ami/corpus/index.shtml) is a multi-modal dataset containing 100 hours of meeting recordings in English.
The parallel version was constructed by asking professional translators to translate utterances from the original corpus into Japanese. Since the original corpus consists of speech transcripts, the English sentences contain a lot of short utterances (e.g., "Yeah", "Okay") or fillers (e.g., "Um"), and these are translated into Japanese as well. Therefore, it contains many duplicate sentences.

We provide training, development and evaluation splits from the AMI Meeting Parallel Corpus. In this repository we publicly share the full development and evaluation sets and a part of the training data set.

|        	| Training 	| Development 	| Evaluation 	|
|--------	|---------:	|:-----------:	|:----------:	|
| Sentences |   20,000 	|       2,000 	|      2,000 	|
| Scenarios |   xxx 	|       xx	 	|      xx	 	|


# Corpus Structure

The corpus is structured in json format consisting of documents, which consist of sentence pairs. Each sentence pair has a sentence number, speaker identifier (to distinguish different speakers), text in English and Japanese, and original language (always English).

```json
[
	[
		{
			"no": 195,
			"speaker": "D",
			"ja_sentence": "ああ、それはぐにゃぐにゃでフルーツのようにとてもなれます。",
			"en_sentence": "Oh, it's very capable of being squishy and fruity.",
			"original_language": "en"
		},
		...
	],
	...
]
```
